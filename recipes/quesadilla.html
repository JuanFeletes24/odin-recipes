    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>½ tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef, <b>I use extra lean ground beef</b></li>
        <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground chipotle chili pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted beef stock/broth, <b>or low sodium or regular</b></li>
        <li>12 ounces shredded cheese blend, <b>divided (about 3 cups. I used a combination of cheddar, Monterey jack and pizza mozzarella)</b></li>
        <li>6 flour tortillas, <b>about 7 to 8 inches in diameter each</b></li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil, <b>to grease pan (about 2 teaspoons of oil per batch)</b></li>
        <li>Salsa, guacamole and/or sour cream, <b>for serving (optional)</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 200°F to keep the quesadillas warm while cooking in batches.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Add ground beef and spices (chili powder, chipotle pepper, oregano, cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper). Cook, breaking up the beef into small pieces and stirring occasionally, until fully cooked and browned, about 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in tomato paste and beef stock/broth, cooking for 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove the beef from the pan and place it in a bowl. Drain any excess grease if necessary.</li>
        <li>Distribute about 8 ounces (2 cups) of cheese evenly on one side of each tortilla. Reserve the remaining 4 ounces (1 cup) of cheese.</li>
        <li>Distribute the ground beef over the cheese, then sprinkle the remaining 1 cup (4 ounces) of cheese on top. Fold each tortilla in half to form a half-moon shape.</li>
        <li>To cook the quesadillas, heat about 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a large non-stick frying pan over medium-low heat. Gently swirl the oil around to coat the pan. If using the same pan from cooking the ground beef, simply wipe it out before greasing and cooking the quesadillas.</li>
        <li>Place two quesadillas in the pan. Cook quesadillas for about 2 minutes on one side.</li>
        <li>Carefully flip the quesadillas and cook for another 2 minutes, or until golden brown and crispy on the outside, with the cheese melted inside (watch closely to prevent burning). Transfer the cooked quesadillas to a sheet pan and place in the preheated oven to keep warm while cooking the remaining quesadillas.</li>
        <li>Repeat process to cook remaining quesadillas.</li>
        <li>Once done, cut each quesadilla in half to create 12 pieces. Serve with salsa, guacamole, and/or sour cream. Enjoy!  
            If you have leftovers, store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days. Reheat before serving.</li>
