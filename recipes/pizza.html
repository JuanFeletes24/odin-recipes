    <h3>Firstable it is important to have sourdough. You can search for any website that provide you a recipe.</h3>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <h4>For the pizza:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>100 g sourdough starter</li>
        <li>350 g water</li>
        <li>500g bread flour </li>
        <li>12 g sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Toppings:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mariana sauce</li>
        <li>Shredded mozzarella</li>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Dried oregano or basil to sprinkle</li>
        <li>Sea salt to sprinkle</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <h4>Feed Starter:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Feed your sourdough starter 6-12 hours before use, with equal parts starter, flour, and water. 
            Typically, 50g of starter, 50g of flour, and 50g of water. Feed it the night before and use it in the morning. It's ready faster in summer than winter.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>Mix Dough</h4>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine all ingredients and mix until well incorporated. The dough will be shaggy and sticky. Cover and let it sit for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>After the dough rests, do a set of stretch and folds: lift each side of the dough and fold it over itself. 
            Wet your hands if it's sticky. Cover the bowl and repeat the stretch and folds every 30 minutes for 3-4 rounds.</li>
        <li>Cover and let the dough bulk ferment for 6-12 hours on the counter. It will take longer in winter and faster in summer.</li>
        <li>After bulk ferment, turn the dough onto a floured surface and divide into 2-3 balls. Oil containers (like Pyrex) and place each dough ball in one. Refrigerate for 6 hours, or up to 2-3 days for a stronger sour flavor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>To Make the Pizza:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 540°F for 30 minutes to 1 hour before baking. A pizza stone works great for a crispy crust.</li>
        <li>To have pizza ready by 5:30pm, pull the dough out of the fridge around 3:30-4pm. Let it come to room temperature for 30 minutes to 1 hour. 
            Dump it onto a floured counter and cover with a tea towel.</li>
        <li>
            To make the pizza, stretch the dough onto parchment paper, pressing it out as thin as possible. If it resists, let it rest for 10 minutes.
            Then top with olive oil, pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella, toppings (like pepperoni), dried oregano, and a sprinkle of sea salt.</li>
        <li>Put your pizza onto the heated steel in the oven and bake for 8-12 minutes until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Note: If you don't have a pizza stone, bake on parchment paper on a baking sheet. It may take longer and won’t be as crispy, but will still be delicious.
             Let cool, slice, and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
